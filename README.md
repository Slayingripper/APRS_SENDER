 Ever had that one guy on APRS who just likes to list fake repeaters? No worries , I Got you covered. 
# The scenario
You have a list of repeaters that you want to use in your APRS network. But you have that one "ham" who just likes to list fake repeaters on APRS so they can get attention. The problem is that even though this is a bit harmless, it's not a good idea to have a bunch of fake repeaters on APRS, as it will confuse a lot of people thinking that a repeater is actually there. Which in an emergency scenario could be a life or death situation. A real world example of this is the Beirut explosion that happened in the year of 2020. Many people were killed and many others were injured. Furthermore, many people were not aware of the explosion and they were not aware of the fact that it was happening. Communications were down and the only thing that was working was radio. Many ham radio operators used repeaters from neighbouring countries to communicate with each other such as Cyprus, Isreal and Turkey.
